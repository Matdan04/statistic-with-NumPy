# statistic-with-NumPy
This repository is dedicated to exploring statistical methods using the NumPy library in Python. 
NumPy is an essential library for numerical computing in Python and provides support for a wide array of statistical operations. The "statistics-with-numpy" repository serves as a resource for statisticians, data scientists, and anyone interested in data analysis.

Within this repository, you will find practical examples and comprehensive tutorials on how to implement various statistical concepts such as:
-Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.)
-Statistical data visualization

Each concept is accompanied by Jupyter Notebooks that provide an interactive environment to execute the Python code and visualize the results. The notebooks are structured to serve as both educational tools for those learning statistics and practical resources for seasoned analysts conducting data exploration and research.
